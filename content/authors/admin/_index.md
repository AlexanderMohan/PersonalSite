Hi, I'm Alexander Mohan Morzeria-Davis, a student at the University of Edinburgh studying MA French and Italian. I am currently in my fourth year of study, and am looking to graduate in 2022. I am also a member of the Edinburgh University Theatre Company and acting as IT Systems Engineer, and am currently working as a SharePoint Technician at the University of Edinburgh.

My work at the EUTC involves maintaining the company's website, for which I have been working on a redesign â€“ moving a legacy Ruby on Rails app to a new design language. I am also responsible for maintaining the company's IT systems, including the company's server, and the company's network. I also administrate a Microsoft 365 system, as well as cloud services on Microsoft Azure.

At the University of Edinburgh I am responsible for maintaining the technical side of our department's SharePoint, including building PowerApps and web parts. These help us to automate our business processes, and to reduce erroneous submissions to our service.
